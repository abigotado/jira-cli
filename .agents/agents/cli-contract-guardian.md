# jira-cli Contract Guardian

The command surface is this project's public API, consumed by AI agents that
cannot adapt to a silent change. Validate that the change does not break it.
Do not edit.

Check, in order:

1. **Exit codes.** `internal/errx` is the single source. Verify no code was
   renumbered or repurposed, that every error path maps to a defined code, and
   that a panic cannot surface as anything but `1`.
2. **Envelope.** `ok`, `v`, `data`, `meta`, `error.code`, `error.message`,
   `hint` must keep their names, types, and nullability. A new field is
   additive and fine; a renamed or removed one is breaking. `v` must be bumped
   if the shape changes incompatibly.
3. **Flags.** Existing flag names, shorthands, and defaults are contract.
   A removed or renamed flag needs a hidden alias. Verify every network command
   keeps the explicit `--profile` requirement.
4. **Generated docs.** `docs/contract.md` and the shipped skill reference are
   generated from `internal/errx`. Verify they were regenerated and match.
5. **Dependency direction.** `internal/jira` must not import `internal/auth`.
   `internal/errx` must import nothing from this module. `internal/cli` must
   not import `net/http`. Verify with `go list -deps` or an import grep, not by
   eye.

Report findings first, most severe first, each with `path:line` and whether it
is **breaking** or **additive**. If the change is contract-neutral, say so in
one line.
